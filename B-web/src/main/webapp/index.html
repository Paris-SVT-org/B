<P>This Web Application contains some micro-benchmark
applications, plus a few interesting utilities.  They are listed
below.</P>

<H2>ping.html, ping.jsp</H2>

<P><A name="ping"></A>A simple <A href="ping.html">page</A> and <A href="ping.jsp">servlet</A>
that do nothing but respond "Ping!".</P>

<H2>large.html</H2>

<P><A name="large.html"></A>A <A href="large.html">large HTML page</A>.
The HTML source size is 63151 bytes.</P>

<H2>reallylarge.html</H2>

<P><A name="reallylarge.jsp"></A>A <A href="reallylarge.jsp?size=1000">very large HTML page (size=1000 means 1000K)</A>.

<P><A name="redirect.jsp"></A>A <A href="redirect.jsp?url=redirected.html">Redirects (302) you to wherever 'url' parameter points.</A>.
E.g. http://yourhost/redirect.jsp?url=http://www.google.com
</P>

<H2>PostEcho</H2>

<FORM action="PostEcho" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
<P>This servlet handles only POST, and
simply copies the request body into the
response body.  For an example,
click <INPUT type="submit" value="send">.
<LABEL>Example input:
</LABEL><INPUT type="text" value="fubar">
</P>
</FORM>

<H2>ResponseFromQuery</H2>

<P>This servlet replies with a response code given in
the query string.  For an example, click
<A href="ResponseFromQuery?responseCode=414">here</A>.</P>

<H2>CpuLoad</H2>

<P><A name="CpuLoad"></A>A single invocation of this servlet applies a controlled amount
of CPU load for a controlled amount of time.
The CPU load consists of doing a given amount of arithmetic per second.
When not doing arithmetic, time is passed in <code>Thread.sleep()</code>.
One parameter is a rate, the rate at which arithmetic units are done.
One unit of arithmetic consists of doing a given number (also a parameter)
of iterations of a certain loop.
This servlet returns a plain text body showing the output of running
for a given amount of time; the invocation does not return until
the given amount of time has passed.
The output has a summary every minute, showing statistics on both
the sleeps and the units of computation; there are both
cumulative statistics and per-minute statistics.
Click <A href="CpuLoad?maxMins=1.01">here</A> for an example
that runs for one minute.
Following are the parameters.</P>

<DL>
	<DT>concurrency</DT>
	<DD>The number of parallel threads to use.</DD>
	
	<DT>kCount</DT>
	<DD>The number of thousands of iterations to use
	as the unit of arithmetic.  An integer.</DD>
	
	<DT>rate</DT>
	<DD>The number of units of arithmetic to do per second.
	This is a float-point number in decimal format</DD>
	
	<DT>sleepMillis</DT>
	<DD>The number of milliseconds to sleep at a time.
	This is an integer.</DD>
	
	<DT>maxMins</DT>
	<DD>The number of minutes for which to apply the load.

<H2>CpuAndSleepBound</H2>

<P><A name="CpuAndSleepBound"></A>Click <A

for an example.  This servlet does a programmable combination of
arithmetic, <code>Thread.yield()</code>, and
<code>Thread.sleep(ms)</code>.  The basic code structure is to
iterate through a loop a certain number of times, invoking
<code>Thread.yield()</code> and <code>Thread.sleep(ms)</code>
every so often.
</P>
<P>This servlet takes several parameters, in the usual HTTP ways
(e.g., an HTTP query string).  All are optional.  Here is an example invocation:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<code>http://host/root/CpuAndSleepBound?deterministic=true&amp;sleepLength=100</code>
</BLOCKQUOTE>The actual values used are echoed in the output.
Following is a list of the available parameters.</P>

<DL>
	<DT><A

	<DD>The number of iterations can be either deterministic or
	chosen randomly from a truncated negative exponential
	distribution; this parameter indicates which it will be.  The
	value should be either <code>true</code> or
	<code>false</code>; default is <code>false</code>.</DD>

	<DT><A name="CpuAndSleepBound_countMax">countMax</A></DT>
	<DD>This parameter is used only if the number of iterations is
	random; in that case, this parameter is the maximum value that
	will be used, should be larger than
	<a href="#CpuAndSleepBound_countMean">countMean</a>, and
	should be less than 2^60.
	The value should be a decimal integer, without
	commas; default is 100,000.</DD>

	<DT><A name="CpuAndSleepBound_countMean">countMean</A></DT>
	<DD>If the number of iterations is deterministic, this
	paramter is it; otherwise, this parameter gives the mean of
	the distribution (without considering the truncation).  The
	value should be a positive decimal integer, without commas,
	and should be less than 2^60; default is 30,000.</DD>

	<DT><A
	name="CpuAndSleepBound_yieldInterval">yieldInterval</A></DT>
	<DD>This parameter gives the number of iterations between
	calls on <code>Thread.yield()</code>.  The value should be a

	whenever the iteration count is equal to 0 modulo the relevant
	<var>interval</var> above; the other choice is when the
	iteration count is equal to half of the interval, modulo the
	interval.  For example, using the first choice, with an
	interval that is at least as large as the actual number of
	iterations, will result in exactly one invocation (the
	counting starts at 0).  For another example, using the second
	choice, with an interval that is at least twice as large as
	the number of iterations, will cause no invocations.  The
	value should be either <code>true</code> or
	<code>false</code>, which code for the first and second
	choices above, respectively; default is
	<code>true</code>.</DD>

	<DT><A
	name="CpuAndSleepBound_sleepLength">sleepLength</A></DT>
	<DD>This parameter gives the number of milliseconds
	<code>ms</code> used in <code>Thread.sleep(ms)</code>.  The

<H2>CpuAndEchoBound</H2>

<P><A name="CpuAndEchoBound"></A>Click <A
href="CpuAndEchoBound?deterministic=true">here</A>
for an example.  This servlet does a programmable combination of
arithmetic, <code>Thread.yield()</code>, and
waiting using an echo or wait server.  The basic code structure is to
iterate through a loop a certain number of times, invoking
<code>Thread.yield()</code> and wait using echo server
every so often. The echo server on TCP port 7, available on many OSes may be used.
If this is used, the sleepLength argument is ignored. If you want something that will sleep,
you can use the simple wait server. The wait server has been packaged into the J2EE ear,
and must be extracted from the ear. Inside an ear file is either a microwebapp.war file or directory.
Within that is the WEB-INF/classes directory. Create a jar file with the contents of the classes directory.
Then run the class <code>com.ibm.wsmm.services.waiter.WaitServer</code>.
This will run an echo server that waits on TCP port 5867.</P>

<P>
To use this servlet, you must tell it the echo or wait server endpoints to use.
These endpoints are put in a pool that is shared by all invocations of this servlet in a given appserver.
Each endpoint is a connection to the echo/wait server.
If you don't have enough endpoints in the pool to handle max concurrency, you will have contention for the endpoints.
There are two ways to specify the endpoints: (1) prepare each appserver with a list of endpoints to use,
or (2) in each invocation pass the list of endpoints to use.  Do only one of these two.
<A name="CpuAndEchoBound_target">The first alternative</A> is done by issuing
the request:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<code>http://host/root/CpuAndEchoBound?target=n,endpoint,endpoint2,...,endpointk</code>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This will create n connections to each of the endpoints specified.
The syntax of an endpoint is <var>host</var>[<code>":"</code><var>port</var>] ---
that is host optionally followed by a colon and port number.  A host can be specified
either by IP address (as parsed by Java) or name.
This must be done with every app server
in the cluster.
This request may be issued multiple times to a server.
Each time the additional endpoints are added to the list of endpoints available.
</P>

<P>The second alternative way to specify the endpoints is to
pass the complete list in every invocation.
No two concurrent invocations should be given different lists.
The list should be changed rarely:
any change in the list involves breaking all the old connections
and making all new connections.
The list of endpoints is passed as a regular parameter, which is among those detailed below.
</P>

<P>This servlet takes several parameters, in the usual HTTP ways

	length <code>sessChunkSize</code>.  If either is elided (or not positive),
	the memory previously held, if any, is released.
	</DD>
	
</DL>

<H2>Additional parameters for failure behavior</H2>
<P>The preceding servlets take the following additional parameters to
simulate three types of failure behavior: internal server failures, 
memory leaks, and deadlocks.
They are all optional, and do not occur by default. Obviously not all 
combinations of the behaviors are possible on a single request. 
The order in which they are checked is: internal failure, servlet processing, 
memory leak, deadlock.  
</P>

<P>
For example, to simulate a memory leak, 
append values for the <code>leakp</code> and <code>amount</code> 
parameters to the query string.  
The following query string would produce a 1000 byte increase 
in memory usage on every request.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<code>http://host/root/CpuAndSleepBound?deterministic=true&amp;sleepLength=100&amp;leakp=100&amp;amount=1000</code>
</BLOCKQUOTE>The actual values used are echoed in the output.
</P>

<P>The parameters whose name ends in "p" affect only the request
on which they appear, while those whose name ends in "All" affect
that request and all subsequent requests served by the same
J2EE module instance.

<DL>
	<DT><A name="leakp">leakp</A></DT>
	<DD>The probability with which the request will allocate additional memory,
	expressed as a number between 0 and 100.   
	This is intended to simulate a memory leak.  The default value is 0. 
	</DD>
	 
	<DT><A name="amount">amount</A></DT>
	<DD>The amount of memory leaked, in bytes, if a leak occurs.  
	The default value is 0.
	</DD>
	
	<DT><A name="deadp">deadp</A></DT> 
	<DD>
	The probability with which the request is suspended, expressed as a number
	between 0 and 100. 
	This is intended to simulate a deadlock by issuing a sleep for 10 minutes.  
	The default value is 0.
	</DD>
	
	<DT><A name="deadTime">deadTime</A></DT> 
	<DD>
	The number of seconds for which this request is suspended due to
	<A href="#deadp">deadp</A>.  
	The default value is 600 (i.e., 10 minutes).
	</DD>
	
	<DT><A name="failp">failp</A></DT> 
	<DD>
	The probability with which the request is failed, expressed as a number
	between 0 and 100.
	A failed request returns an internal server error (error code 500)
	immediately - no servlet processing or other failure behaviors occur. 
	The default value is 0. 
	</DD>
	
	<DT><A name="failAll">failAll</A></DT>
	<DD>
	If set to <code>true</code>, creates a persistent failure
	until explicitly cleared.  This is useful as a "poison pill" which can be
	sent to a subset of members of a cluster.  When used in combination with
	<code>failp</code>, the request fails if either a persistent failure 
	or a request failure is indicated.
	If set to <code>false</code>, clears the persistent failure condition.
	The default value is to make no change in the persistent failure condition.
	</DD>

	<DT><A name="deadTimeAll">deadTimeAll</A></DT>
	<DD>
	The value, if given, should be an integer; it is a number of seconds.
	If set to a positive value, creates a persistent deadlock
	until explicitly cleared --- but this request
	does not itself hang due to this condition.
	This is useful as a "poison pill" which can be
	sent to a subset of members of a cluster.  When used in combination with
	<code>deadp</code>, the request deadlocks if either a persistent deadlock 
	or a request deadlock is indicated; if both are, the length of the hang
	is specified by <code>deadTimeAll</code>.
	If set to <code>0</code>, clears the persistent deadlock condition without
	deadlocking due to it.
	The default value is to make no change in the persistent deadlock condition.
